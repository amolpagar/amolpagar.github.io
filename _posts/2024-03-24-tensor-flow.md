# Building a Sentiment Analysis Model using Python and TensorFlow

In this tutorial, we will build a simple sentiment analysis model using Python and TensorFlow. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a piece of text. We will use a dataset of movie reviews to train our model and then test it on new reviews to see how well it performs.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn
